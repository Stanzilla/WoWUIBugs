# World of Warcraft UI Community Bug Tracker

This issue tracker is used by the WoW UI developer community to document bugs for Blizzard with a chance of getting them looked at.

There are no guarantees that issues reported here are getting fixed, but Blizzard is looking at the list and will fix things according to their priorities and schedules.

To increase the changes of an issue getting noticed by them, bugs can additionally be reported in-game through the problem reporter tool, with links to tickets created here.

We might sometimes close an issue as "stale" when there has been no interest or updates from Blizzard regarding it.
