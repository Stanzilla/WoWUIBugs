# World of Warcraft UI Community Bug Tracker

This issue tracker is used by the WoW UI developer community to document bugs for Blizzard with a chance of getting them looked at.

There are no guarantees that issues reported here will be fixed, but Blizzard is looking at the list and will triage issues according to their priorities and schedules.

To improve visibility for the development team issues should additionally be reported in-game through the problem reporter or support tools with a brief summary and a link to a ticket created here copied into the report. Bug reports submitted here should - where possible - include a minimal reproducible test case either as an attached addon or an in-line code snippet, and steps to reproduce the issue.

We might sometimes close an issue as "stale" when there has been no interest or updates from Blizzard regarding it.
